Hi, YiJune here!

I’ve been enjoying exploring data management and machine learning applications.
So far, I’ve worked on projects like comparing ML algorithms for user sentiment analysis and
predicting stock prices using transformers. Recently, I built a hotel occupancy forecasting model with LightGBM.

Check out the details on my GitHub! I’m always open to learning, collaborating,
or exchanging knowledge about data, AI, and beyond.
