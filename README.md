Hi, YiJune here!
Iâ€™ve been enjoying exploring data management and machine learning applications.
So far, Iâ€™ve worked on projects like comparing ML algorithms for user sentiment classification and
predicting stock prices using transformers. Recently, I built a hotel occupancy forecasting model with LightGBM.

Check out the details on my GitHub! Iâ€™m always open to learning, collaborating,
or exchanging knowledge about data, AI, or anything interesting. Feel free to reach out! ðŸ‘€ðŸ“«
